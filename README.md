# Madridweatherreport
After collecting a sample of the daily weather in Madrid from 1997 till 2015 we would like to make some analysis using the data given to understand more of the nature of the weather in Madrid and also to be able to make futrhur decisions based on the weather. This dataset was provided by Maven Analytics in the following [link](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?page=6&pageSize=5) 

The questions we would like to answer are:
    
1) During the time period in this sample, what % of days had some sort of precipitation event? What % were clear?

2) Suppose you're planning a vacation to Madrid and hoping for the warmest temperature. Which month might you plan to travel?

3) On which date in the sample did Madrid see the fastest wind gust? What was the weather like on that day?

4) How does the average visibility (Km) compare for clear days vs. foggy days?

I will be providing answers to these questions using both numbers and charts to make it both visually appealing and easy to understand.
